# Hi, I'm [Amir Akbari] 👋

 I am working as an Odoo deployment expert, focusing
 on its development in the accounting, commerce,
 purchasing, and sales modules. I strive to ensure the
 best deployment by observing internal controls and
 meeting the needs of various industries. My field of
 study has been accounting, as reflected in my diploma,
 post-graduate, and undergraduate degrees. With my
 background in programming, I transitioned into the
 ERP field to combine my expertise in accounting,
 programming, and ERP to deliver optimal solutions
